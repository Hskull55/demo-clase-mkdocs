Due to his genetic mutations, he appeared leaner, fairer, and younger than his fellow clone troopers. Tech served as the brains of his squad and was a valued asset in this regard, using his high intellect and mastery of technology to ensure their operations were successful. Even so, he was no less skilled in combat than the other three members. Tech deserted the Empire shortly after its proclamation, along with the human female clone Omega and the other members of the Bad Batch, except for CC-9904 \"Crosshair\", who remained loyal to the Empire and soon started tracking his former squad. He and the Bad Batch became mercenaries for the Mantellian Trandoshan Ciddarin \"Cid\" Scaleback but were forced to come back to Kamino to rescue their fellow clone brother Hunter, who had been captured by the Empire. Tech then witnessed the destruction of the Kaminoan capital Tipoca City and was thought to have died during its fall. However, he and the Bad Batch survived and sought to avoid drawing the attention of the Empire, while continuing their mercenary missions. Noticia triste Se ha muerto :( Plan 99 \"When have we ever followed orders?\" \u2015Tech's last words before sacrificing himself Tech sacrificed himself so that his squad could evacuate. Stuck in the skies of Eriadu, the clones were attacked by stormtroopers stationed in a car at the other end of the rail line. With no power available, Tech proposed to reboot the system manually through the terminals present on the track while his squad covered him. Tech quickly reached the top of the rail line and accessed its control panel. However, Tarkin then ordered several stormtroopers to take the clones out with V-wing starfighters. Understanding that they could not stand a chance, Hunter warned Tech and asked him to be quick. Ultimately, Tech managed to reactivate the power. However, the clones could not prevent their car from being damaged by the starfighters, causing it to hang loose. Tech tried to use his grappling cable to hold onto the carriage but warned that any additional weight would cause the rear carriage to fall. Tech implored his squadmates to sever the connection hinge. After they refused, Tech declared that he would now use \"Plan 99\" before stating that Clone Force 99 had never been used to following orders anyway. Tech then sacrificed himself by shooting the hinge himself.","title":"Tech"},{"location":"datos/#informacion-importante","text":"Tech was a clone commando who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars as a member of Clone Force 99, also known as the \"Bad Batch\", and who later deserted the Galactic Empire.
